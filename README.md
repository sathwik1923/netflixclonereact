# Netflix Frontend React Clone

This project is a **Netflix clone** built with **React**. It replicates the frontend design and functionality of the Netflix platform, providing a similar user interface and experience. The application displays movies and TV shows dynamically, pulls data from the **TMDb API (The Movie Database)**, and offers features like category-based movie listings, search functionality, and hover-over previews.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Movie Listings**: Displays different categories of movies and TV shows (e.g., Trending, Top Rated, Netflix Originals).
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for movies and TV shows.
- **Hover Preview**: Displays more information about the movie/TV show when the user hovers over an item.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Movie Details**: Users can view detailed information about a movie, including descriptions, ratings, release dates, and more.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library used for building the UI.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different pages and views in the application.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the components and layout of the page.
- **Axios**: To make HTTP requests to fetch data from the TMDb API.
